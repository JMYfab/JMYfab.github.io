<p>
JMY Fabrication builds fully customized online stores for businesses, organizations and teams across the United States. Based in New York and serving clients nationwide, we create streamlined storefront programs that eliminate the complexity of ordering branded apparel and promotional merchandise.
</p>

<h2>Corporate & Business Apparel Programs</h2>
<p>
For companies looking to maintain brand consistency, simplify employee ordering and centralize apparel management, our online store programs provide a professional solution. Businesses can offer approved uniforms, polos, hoodies, outerwear and promotional products through a secure, easy-to-navigate storefront. Ideal for onboarding programs, trade shows, employee recognition initiatives and long-term branding strategies.
</p>

<h2>Team & Organization Stores</h2>
<p>
Sports teams, schools, community organizations and associations benefit from professionally managed spirit wear and merchandise programs. We design custom storefronts that showcase your brand while simplifying the ordering process for members, supporters and families. From embroidered polos to printed hoodies and promotional merchandise, every store is built for clarity, quality and ease of use.
</p>

<h2>Year-Round Store Options</h2>
<p>
Unlike limited pop-up sales, we offer year-round storefront options. This allows employees or members to order whenever they need apparel, reducing administrative work and eliminating repeated ordering cycles. Year-round stores improve consistency, convenience and long-term brand presence.
</p>

<h2>Production & Fulfillment Managed for You</h2>
<p>
We handle everything behind the scenes — product setup, printing, embroidery, engraving, order management, quality control and fulfillment. Your organization never needs to manage inventory or collect payments. We provide a professionally managed system designed for efficiency and scalability.
</p>

<h2>Branding & Quality Standards</h2>
<p>
Our production capabilities include custom printed apparel, precision embroidery and high-quality promotional merchandise. Stores can feature water bottles, key chains, engraved items, corporate gifts and branded accessories that align with your organization’s standards.
